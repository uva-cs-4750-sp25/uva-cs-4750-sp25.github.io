## Course Description and Requirements

This course introduces the fundamental concepts for the design and development of database systems.

### Major Topics

The course will focus on five main concepts:

* Database design - philosophies and techniques, such as E-R and normalization
* Query Languages - Relational Algebra and SQL
* Database System Implementation - The basics of **how** a database works, including data storage, indexing, and transactions
* Database Models - We will look primarily at relational databases, but will also explore NoSQL
* Database Management - Managing database users, external interfacing, database security, etc.


### Course Requirements and Expectations

1. Prerequisite: Old Curriculum - CS 2150 / New Curriculum - CS 3140 **C-** or above   
   * Be aware that if you are enrolled in this class but have not met the prerequisite, you will be removed by the CS Office.   
   * Because of the large waitlist, I will not be making any exceptions to this prerequisite.   
2. You should plan to regularly attend class. 
   * Slides, examples, and notes will be posted on Drive
   * Lectures will not be recorded
   * There will be "in-class" practices where you are encouraged to work with others.
3. While our class will cover SQL code, database management, etc., you will also need to do some independent learning
   * On the final project, you will work with a team to build a meaningful database of meaningful data
   * You will also need to build some GUI frontend for your database. 
   * We will look at only very limited database access frameworks in class. You will need to do your own research for building a frontend of your team's choice in a programming language of your team's choice.

## Communication and Logistics

### Piazza
{: .no_toc }

Piazza @ [https://piazza.com/class/m5v50o8mwqt2mp](https://piazza.com/class/lr546t74wl57e/)    

We will be using Piazza for the following:

* Long-form questions about the class, code, or project (please post all code privately!)
* Private messages for faculty or the entire staff
* A searchable repository of common questions in the course about the project, assignments, etc.

We will not be using Piazza for:

* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then office hours only if not resolved)

### Email
{: .no_toc }

We will be using email for the following:

* Personal issues that can and should only be handled by a professor
* Team issues that need to be escalated beyond the TA

We will not be using email for:

* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then professor office hours if not resolved - TAs will not review regrade requests)
* Tech setup help (use Piazza or Office Hours)
* Project questions (use Piazza or Office Hours)
* Guided Practice questions (use Piazza)

_PLEASE_ make sure to put "CS 4750" in the subject line somewhere so I can keep track of your request!  And please be patient with me in responding.  I receive A LOT of email and it's easy to get behind.  If there is a time-critical nature to your note, please let me know that as well.

## Assessment and Grading
We will utilize a positive-reinforcement grading policy in this course. Your grade in this course will be based on experience points (XP). Every student begins the course with 0 XP.  As you complete assessments and quizzes, you will earn XP.  Some assessments will have a way to retake or resubmit to earn some of the XP that was not earned on the first attempt.  Please see individual assessments for more information regarding how this mechanic works.

| Assessment	         | Who	            | Grade % |
|:--------------------|:----------------|:--------|
| Practice of the Day | 	Individual     | 15%     |
| Homework            | 	Individual     | 30%     |
| Project             | 	Group Required | 25%     |
| Quiz 1              | 	Individual     | 10%     |
| Quiz 2              | 	Individual     | 10%     |
| Quiz 3              | 	Individual     | 10%     |


## Assessments

### Practice of the Day - 15%

Specifically while covering SQL code, we will have a number (likely 5-6) of "start in-class" practices. In-class cooperation on these assignments is encouraged. These are submitted as short SQL scripts to Gradescope. They must be completed by the start of the next lecture after they are assigned. **There are no late submissions accepted on POTD assignments.**

### Homework - 30%

You will have roughly 8-10 homeworks assignments. These assignments will include coding, written questions, etc. Homeworks
will be due at 11:59 p.m. on their posted due date. These are individual assignments unless otherwise noted. 

The homework learning objectives will correlate closely with quiz questions

### Quizzes - 30%

Quizzes are **in-class, closed note, paper and pencil**. No electronic devices will be allowed during the quizzes.

Quizzes are not intended to be cumulative, focusing on material covered in that quiz unit. However, as some course concepts build on others, we cannot say that the quizzes are 100% independent. For example, setting up database permissions requires an understanding of database reading and writing covered in a previous unit.

Quiz dates are highlighted in **red** on the course schedule

Quiz retakes will be held during the final exam portion of the course. Up to 1 quiz's worth of points (10% of the class grade) can be made up during the retake. However, all points earned on a retake will be reduced by 20% (so, for instance, if you made up 20 points on the quiz retake, it would scale down to 16 points)

This will be **Monday, May 5, 2p.m. to 5p.m. in Rice Hall 130**.

There is no final exam, and so this period is completely optional.

### Project - 25%

A project will provide you the opportunity to explore and experience database design and programming in practice. The project will entail the design of a database, with all accompanying evidence of its good design, along with front-end and back-end components that will interact with the database to provide common functionalities such as record inserting, updating, deleting, browsing, and searching and filtering.

You will collaborate with at least two and at most three other students in this course (Groups are 3-4). You will choose what to build, with the project constraining the features that must be used. The project must be complex enough so that it is not a trivial exercise, but cannot be so complex as to take longer than two months of effort.

You will be provided with a PostgreSQL database server for your group.

You may choose to implement your project in one of the two ways:

Web-based project — you will be provided with a PostgreSQL database server. You may use any programming language(s) and frameworks(s) and host your web application on any web server of your choice (such as Heroku).
Non-web-based project — you may host your application locally, such as a Desktop app, using any programming language(s) or framework(s)


### Attendance
{: .no_toc }

* Attendance in lecture is vital to learning the material and making a good grade in this class.
* **Lectures will not be recorded!** While slides and some in-class code examples will be uploaded, lecture recordings will not be made available.
* That said, you are adults and can make your own decisions regarding coming or not coming to class.  I will not take attendance.
* It is not necessary to inform me of missing a class __unless__ you are missing one of the noted quiz days.
* If you are going to miss a quiz, you must inform me more than 48 hours in advance to discuss your reason and options for making up the quiz (if possible).

### Late Policy
{: .no_toc }

* Homeworks may be submitted up to 24 hours late, but will incur a 20% penalty.
* Homeworks will not be accepted after 24 hours for any reason.
* Practices-of-the-Day are due **before** the start of the next lecture, and **will not be accepted late for any reason.**
* Project deliverables **will not be accepted late for any reason.**

### This Syllabus
{: .no_toc }
This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification. It is up to the student to monitor this page for any changes. Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.

### Professionalism
{: .no_toc }
In this course, there will be a focus on working well together and learning about the development process. A large portion of that process involves interpersonal skills and conflict management. Students and staff are all expected to treat each other with respect.  This includes, but certainly is not limited to:

* Proper use of class platforms (Discord, Piazza, YouTube comments, etc.)
* Respectful behavior in class (including extraneous internet browsing, social media, phone usage, etc.)
* Respectful language or actions to course staff or other students
* Promptness for all deadlines and class meetings
* Quality work
* Working well with your partners
* Following the honor code and other collaboration policies
* Following any University health and safety regulations

Students can and will be penalized for unprofessional behavior.

## Academic Integrity
_Summary_:

* Know the honor code
* Work with your team, but not any other team
* Using code from other students (from any semester) is an honor violation
* Using publicly-available example code and libraries is fine, but you must cite your resources
* More information on what is allowed will be included with each assignment if necessary
* It never hurts to ask the staff what is allowed or not allowed!

The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 

Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud [http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud](http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud). Assessments will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask! Unless otherwise noted, all assessments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homeworks. 

Using code developed by previous students in the course or code written for your use by someone outside the course is not allowed and will likely be an honor violation. This does not apply to the use of publicly available frameworks and libraries, unless indicated in the assessment instructions.

In general, we expect that you will be using code, examples, and ideas from many different websites and resources for your projects.  This is allowed within reason.  Wholesale copying of an entire project or any major feature from any source (the web, another student, etc.) is definitely not allowed.  Using code snippts that you find to round out a feature is allowed.  If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, ask first!

In ALL cases, you need to cite all sources at the top of the file where the code or algorithm was used AND you should note all sources in your documentation.  Failure to properly attribute your sources will result in a 50% penalty for the project at a minimum.

## External Resources policy

**You are allowed and encouraged to use external resources** like StackOverflow, 
Geeksforgeeks, etc. for looking up help with **individual parts**
of your assignments (such as specific syntax for SQL). Professional
programmers look up syntax, library and class usage examples, etc. all the time.

However, **you may not copy large portions of external source code** from online.
If you find you are copying more than 8 lines or so, you should stop. Copying code from any external source for significant portions of the assignment is considered academic dishonesty, and will be treated as such.

**All external references must be cited in your code comments!** (See How to Cite Code)

### AI Assistance rules

AI Tools should only be used to help you **learn**, not avoid a struggle! [https://www.jenmoulton.com/butterfly-struggle/]

Use of AI Assistants, like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. is allowed when used appropriately and with citation. The rules are the same as StackOverflow - you may copy small snippets of code (typically small functions, etc.). You should not however, attempt to use such tools to complete entire assignments.

**All AI tool use must be cited in your code comments!!!** (See below)

**All "chat logs" with AI tools must be saved!**

Last bit: [this article is worth a read](https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality)

Highlight:

> "The projections for 2024 utilize OpenAI's gpt-4-1106-preview Assistant to run a
quadratic regression on existing data. The full method used to interrogate the OpenAI
Assistant is provided in the Appendix. Given the exponential growth of Copilot
reported by GitHub, and AI Assistants in general, it seems likely that 2024's numbers
will continue the trends that began to take form in 2022 and accelerated in 2023.
Looking only at the differences in operation frequency between 2022 and 2023, we
find three red flags for code quality:
> * Moved code - -17.3%
> * Copy/Pasted code - 11.3%
> * Churn - 39.2%
> ...
> Recall that "Churn" is the percentage of code that was pushed to the repo, then
    subsequently reverted, removed or updated within 2 weeks."

### How to Cite Code

Use the following format as an example citing code you use. You may not have all of these fields available, but this should give you a good idea of things to look for.  Order by title of the software package.  Use the appropriate commenting format for the programming language of your source code.

Below is a general example of a citation format. This should appear **above** any code derived from an external source.

```
//  URL: <where it's located>
//  Description: <what you used, be very specific with line numbers>
```

If you get help from a TA or professor, you must also cite
that in your code.

```
//  Person: Name of TA or professor - you must include a name. "A TA" is not acceptable.
//  Description: <what you got help with, be very specific with line numbers>
```

If using an AI assistant, you must cite as follows:

```
//  AI Agent: (ChatGPT, Copilot, whatever)
//  Prompt: The *exact* prompt you used.
```

Additionally, all LLM conversation logs should be saved on your local machine.

Forgetting to cite your code with your sources is not a defense against an academic
integrity violation, and will not be accepted as such. Ignorance of the rules
will not be accepted as a defense for violating them.

## Miscellaneous Policies

### Inclement Weather Policy
{: .no_toc }
If there is the possibility of inclement weather that could affect class, it is your responsibility to stay informed.  Information about how to sign up for email and/or text alerts from UVA Emergency Management, along with the current University status, can be found at [https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/](https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/).

### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
{: .no_toc }
It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please make an appointment to with your instructor outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at [cmacmasters@virginia.edu](mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu) to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: [sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu](http://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu). 

If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send your instructor your accommodation letter as soon as possible. We happily and discretely provide the recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC. For quizzes and other individual assessments, please remind us one week before an exam so we can make accommodations.  For team related assessments, we cannot grant significant accommodations for an entire team due to just one person. However, we are more than happy to discuss with you the best way to integrate with your team with your accommodations in consideration. Please make an appointment with your instructor outside of office hours to have this discussion.

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.), please contact the instructor as soon as you know these may affect you in class.

### Religious Accommodations
{: .no_toc }
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to their instructor by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200.

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework - including the team project - missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Support for Career Development
{: .no_toc }
Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. We wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify your instructor by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.

### Student Support Team
{: .no_toc }
You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help! 

__NOTE:__ These resources are available for BACS majors as well!  You are still a part of our department!

You are also urged to use [TimelyCare](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/timelycare) for either scheduled or on-demand 24/7 mental health care. 

### Community and Identity
{: .no_toc }
The [Center for Diversity in Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/diversity-and-engagement/center-diversity-engineering) (CDE) is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world.  The CDE includes an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.


### Statement on Violence
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence) that describes reporting options and resources available.  

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  [UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009) based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. [UVA policy](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010) also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. 

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to [Just Report It](https://justreportit.virginia.edu/) (justreportit.virginia.edu) or [contact EOCR](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu), the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to [Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”)](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps) and [Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/confidential-advocates) (for students of all genders).  

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community.
